**Focus!** is a free productivity app that combines the power of the Pomodoro
Technique with the engaging elements of RPGs to help you achieve your goals,
improve your focus, and develop valuable skills.

## Overview

Focus! implements the Flowmodoro technique.


**Here's how it works:**

1.  **Define Your Quests (Goals):** Set meaningful goals that align with your
    aspirations, whether it's mastering a new programming language, writing a
    book, or improving your fitness.
2.  **Embrace the Flowmodoro Technique:** Break down your work into focused
    blcocked intervals (Pomodoros) separated by short breaks. This proven
    technique enhances concentration and prevents burnout.
3.  **Level Up Your Skills:** As you complete Pomodoros and achieve goals, you
    earn experience points (XP) in various skills, categorized into RPG-inspired
    attributes:
    *   **Intelligence:** Sharpen your mind through reading, learning, and problem-solving.
    *   **Willpower:** Build your focus, discipline, and resistance to distractions.
    *   **Dexterity:** Enhance your efficiency, time management, and task completion speed.
    *   **Vitality:** Boost your energy levels and overall well-being through healthy habits.
4.  **Track Your Character's Growth:** Watch your character sheet grow as you
    level up your skills and attributes, unlocking new achievements and a deeper
    sense of accomplishment.
